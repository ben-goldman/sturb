The results are interpreted on the basis of a scaling analysis of the governing equations. The analysis suggests that there are two different strongly stratified regimes according to the parameter . When , viscous forces are unimportant and lv scales as lv {$\sim$} U/N (U is a characteristic horizontal velocity and N is the Brunt\textendash V\"ais\"al\"a frequency) so that the dynamics of the flow is inherently three-dimensional but strongly anisotropic. When , vertical viscous shearing is important so that  (lh is a characteristic horizontal length scale). The parameter  is further shown to be related to the buoyancy Reynolds number and proportional to (lO/{$\eta$})4/3, where lO is the Ozmidov length scale and {$\eta$} the Kolmogorov length scale. This implies that there are simultaneously two distinct ranges in strongly stratified turbulence when : the scales larger than lO are strongly influenced by the stratification while those between lO and {$\eta$} are weakly affected by stratification. The direct numerical simulations with forced large-scale horizontal two-dimensional motions and uniform stratification cover a wide Re and Fh range and support the main parameter controlling strongly stratified turbulence being . The numerical results are in good agreement with the scaling laws for the vertical length scale. Thin horizontal layers are observed independently of the value of  but they tend to be smooth for {$<$} 1, while for  {$>$} 1 small-scale three-dimensional turbulent disturbances are increasingly superimposed. The dissipation of kinetic energy is mostly due to vertical shearing for  {$<$} 1 but tends to isotropy as  increases above unity. When  {$<$} 1, the horizontal and vertical energy spectra are very steep while, when  {$>$} 1, the horizontal spectra of kinetic and potential energy exhibit an approximate k-5/3h-power-law range and a clear forward energy cascade is observed.},

The Dedalus project is a flexible, open-source, parallelized computational framework for solving general partial differential equations using spectral methods. Dedalus translates plain-text strings describing partial differential equations into efficient solvers. This paper details the numerical method that enables this translation, describes the design and implementation of the codebase, and illustrates its capabilities with a variety of example problems. The numerical method is a first-order generalized tau formulation that discretizes equations into banded matrices. This method is implemented with an object-oriented design. Classes for spectral bases and domains manage the discretization and automatic parallel distribution of variables. Discretized fields and mathematical operators are symbolically manipulated with a basic computer algebra system. Initial value, boundary value, and eigenvalue problems are efficiently solved using high-performance linear algebra, transform, and parallel communication libraries. Custom analysis outputs can also be specified in plain text and stored in self-describing portable formats. The performance of the code is evaluated with a parallel scaling benchmark and a comparison to a finite-volume code. The features and flexibility of the codebase are illustrated by solving several examples: the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a graph, a supersonic magnetohydrodynamic vortex, quasigeostrophic flow, Stokes flow in a cylindrical annulus, normal modes of a radiative atmosphere, and diamagnetic levitation.},

  abstract = {Most turbulent flows appearing in nature (e.g. geophysical and astrophysical flows) are subjected to strong rotation and stratification. These effects break the symmetries of classical, homogenous isotropic turbulence. In doing so, they introduce a natural decomposition of phase space in terms of wave modes and potential vorticity modes. The appearance of a new time scale, associated with the propagation of waves, hinders the understanding of energy transfers across scales. For instance, it is difficult to predict a priori whether the energy cascades downscale as in homogeneous isotropic turbulence or upscale as expected from balanced dynamics. In this paper, we suggest a theoretical approach based on equilibrium statistical mechanics for the ideal system, inspired by the restricted partition function formalism introduced in metastability studies. We focus on the qualitative features of the inviscid system, taking into account either all the modes or just the slow modes. Specifically, we show that at absolute equilibrium, i.e.~when all the modes are considered, no negative temperature states exist, and the isotropic energy spectrum is close to equipartition. By contrast, when the statistics is restricted to the contributions of the slow modes, we find that in the presence of rotation, there exists a regime of negative temperature featuring an infrared divergence in both the isotropic and the axisymmetric average energy spectrum, characteristic of an inverse cascade regime. Such regimes are not allowed for purely stratified flows, even in the restricted ensemble, because the slow manifold then partitions into modes that carry potential vorticity on the one hand, and hydrostatically balanced but vorticity-free modes, the so-called vertical shear horizontal flows, on the other hand, which forbid the appearance of negative temperatures.},

The Prandtl number Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\} quantifies the relative strengths of viscosity and buoyancy diffusivity, which damp small-scale velocity and buoyancy fluctuations at different microscales. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) require high resolution to resolve the smallest flow features for large Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}. To reduce computational demand, Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\} is often set to 1. In this paper, we explore how varying Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\} affects stratified turbulence. DNS of homogeneous forced stratified turbulence with 0.7{$\leq$}Pr{$\leq$}80.7 \textbackslash le \textbackslash textit \{Pr\} \textbackslash le 8 are performed for four stratification strengths and buoyancy Reynolds numbers Reb\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_b between 0.5 and 60.

For Reb{$\greaterequivlnt$}10\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_b \textbackslash gtrsim 10, Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}-dependence in the kinetic energy is mainly found at scales around and below the Kolmogorov scale. The potential energy and flux exhibit more prominent Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}-sensitivity.

With increasing Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}, the spectra suggest eventual convergence to a limiting spectrum shape at large, finite Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}, at least at scales at and above the Ozmidov scale. The Pr\textbackslash textit \{Pr\}-sensitivity of the spectra in the most strongly stratified Reb{$<$}1\textbackslash textit \{Re\}\_b{$<$}1 case differed from the rest, since large horizontal scales are affected by viscosity and diffusion.

Still, there are few publicly available research codes and, due to the heavy number crunching implied, available codes are usually written in low-level languages such as C/C++ or Fortran. In this paper we describe a pure scientific Python pseudo-spectral DNS code that nearly matches the performance of C++ for thousands of processors and billions of unknowns. We also describe a version optimized through Cython, that is found to match the speed of C++. The solvers are written from scratch in Python, both the mesh, the MPI domain decomposition, and the temporal integrators. The solvers have been verified and benchmarked on the Shaheen supercomputer at the KAUST supercomputing laboratory, and we are able to show very good scaling up to several thousand cores. A very important part of the implementation is the mesh decomposition (we implement both slab and pencil decompositions) and 3D parallel Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT). The mesh decomposition and FFT routines have been implemented in Python using serial FFT routines (either NumPy, pyFFTW or any other serial FFT module), NumPy array manipulations and with MPI communications handled by MPI for Python (mpi4py). We show how we are able to execute a 3D parallel FFT in Python for a slab mesh decomposition using 4 lines of compact Python code, for which the parallel performance on Shaheen is found to be slightly better than similar routines provided through the FFTW library. For a pencil mesh decomposition 7 lines of code is required to execute a transform.},

The evolution of the mixing layer includes shear instability, formation of Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz rollers, transition to turbulence, fully developed active turbulence, and, finally, decay toward a laminar state. In the Jd case, internal gravity waves carrying momentum and energy are observed to propagate away from the shear layer. Although different during the initial evolution, the eddy diffusivity and mixing efficiency when plotted as a function of buoyancy, Reynolds number takes similar values between the two cases later in time during the stage when turbulence decays. During this stage, the mixing efficiency computed based on the buoyancy flux is approximately 0.35, while the mixing efficiency estimated from the scalar dissipation is approximately 0.4. Parameterization of the eddy diffusivity in terms of Reynolds numbers and gradient Richardson number is also discussed.},

Turbulent mixing in the radiative zones is currently taken into account in stellar evolution models through a set of diffusion coefficients that are generally poorly constrained.\emph{Aims.{$<$}i/{$>$} We want to constrain the form of one of them, the radial diffusion coefficient of chemical elements due to the turbulence driven by radial differential rotation, derived by Zahn (1974, IAU Symp., 59, 185 and 1992, A\&A, 265, 115) on phenomenological grounds and largely used since.\emph{Methods.{$<$}i/{$>$} We performed local, direct numerical simulations of stably stratified homogeneous sheared turbulence using the Boussinesq approximation. The domain of low P\'eclet numbers found in stellar interiors is currently inaccessible to numerical simulations without approximation. It is explored here thanks to a suitable asymptotic form of the Boussinesq equations. The turbulent transport of a passive scalar is determined in statistical steady states.\emph{Results.{$<$}i/{$>$} We provide a first quantitative determination of the turbulent diffusion coefficient and find that the form proposed by Zahn is in good agreement with the results of the numerical simulations.}}}}},

  abstract = {The spectral eddy viscosity (SEV) concept is a handy tool for the derivation of large-eddy simulation (LES) turbulence models and for the evaluation of their performance in predicting the spectral energy transfer. We compute this quantity by filtering and truncating fully resolved turbulence data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of neutrally and stably stratified homogeneous turbulence. The results qualitatively confirm the plateau\textendash cusp shape, which is often assumed to be universal, but show a strong dependence on the test filter size. Increasing stable stratification not only breaks the isotropy of the SEV but also modifies its basic shape, which poses a great challenge for implicit and explicit LES methods. We find indications that for stably stratified turbulence it is necessary to use different subgrid-scale (SGS) models for the horizontal and vertical velocity components. Our data disprove models that assume a constant positive effective turbulent Prandtl number.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of quasi-horizontal motions in a stably stratified fluid have been simulated for Froude numbers of order 1, so that the flows are strongly affected by the stable density stratification, and for a range of Reynolds numbers. It is found that the horizontal scales of the motion grow continuously in time. The vertical scales decrease and the vertical shearing increases with time, maintaining the Richardson number of order 1, as suggested by Lilly [J. Atmos. Sci. 40, 749 (1983)] and Babin et al. [Theor. Comput. Fluid Dyn. 9, 223 (1997)]. Small-scale instabilities and turbulent-like motions are observed to occur in the high shearing regions, while the larger-scale motions appear to evolve somewhat independently of the Reynolds number. The results suggest that the larger-scale, quasi-horizontal motions would be a continuous source of smaller-scale turbulence until the local Reynolds number drops below a critical value, which is estimated. Finally, a Froude number based upon a vertical differential scale and used in previous scaling arguments and theories is estimated in terms of other parameters.},

  abstract = {There is a clear distinction between simple laminar and complex turbulent fluids; however, in some cases, as for the nocturnal planetary boundary layer, a stable and well-ordered flow can develop intense and sporadic bursts of turbulent activity that disappear slowly in time. This phenomenon is ill understood and poorly modeled and yet it is central to our understanding of weather and climate dynamics. We present here data from direct numerical simulations of stratified turbulence on grids of 20483 points that display the somewhat paradoxical result of measurably stronger events for more stable flows, not only in the temperature and vertical velocity derivatives as commonplace in turbulence, but also in the amplitude of the fields themselves, contrary to what happens for homogenous isotropic turbulent flows. A flow visualization suggests that the extreme values take place in Kelvin-Helmoltz overturning events and fronts that develop in the field variables. These results are confirmed by the analysis of a simple model that we present. The model takes into consideration only the vertical velocity and temperature fluctuations and their vertical derivatives. It indicates that in stably stratified turbulence, the stronger bursts can occur when the flow is expected to be more stable. The bursts are generated by a rapid nonlinear amplification of energy stored in waves and are associated with energetic interchanges between vertical velocity and temperature (or density) fluctuations in a range of parameters corresponding to the well-known saturation regime of stratified turbulence.},

  abstract = {,  We extend the scaling relations of strongly (stably) stratified turbulence from the geophysical regime of unity Prandtl number to the astrophysical regime of extremely small Prandtl number applicable to stably stratified regions of stars and gas giants. A transition to a new turbulent regime is found to occur when the Prandtl number drops below the inverse of the buoyancy Reynolds number, i.e. PrRb{$<$}1PrRb{$<$}1Pr\textbackslash,Rb{$<$}1, which signals a shift of the dominant balance in the buoyancy equation. Application of critical balance arguments then derives new predictions for the anisotropic energy spectrum and dominant balance of the Boussinesq equations in the PrRb{$\ll$}1PrRb{$\ll$}1Pr\textbackslash,Rb\textbackslash ll 1 regime. We find that all the standard scaling relations from the unity PrPrPr limit of strongly stratified turbulence simply carry over if the Froude number, FrFrFr, is replaced by a modified Froude number, FrM{$\equiv$}Fr/(PrRb)1/4FrM{$\equiv$}Fr/(PrRb)1/4Fr\_M\textbackslash equiv Fr/(Pr\textbackslash,Rb)\^\{1/4\}. The geophysical and astrophysical regimes are thus smoothly connected across the PrRb=1PrRb=1Pr\textbackslash,Rb=1 transition. Applications to vertical transport in stellar radiative zones and modification to the instability criterion for the small-scale dynamo are discussed.},

  abstract = {Continuously forced, stratified shear flows occur in many geophysical systems, including flow over sills, through fjords and at the mouths of rivers and estuaries. These continuously forced shear flows can be unstable and drive turbulence, which can enhance the rate of mixing. In this study, we analyse three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of an idealized stratified shear flow that is continuously forced by weakly relaxing both the buoyancy and streamwise velocity towards prescribed mean profiles. We explore a range of large and small Richardson numbers, for constant Reynolds and Prandtl numbers ( and ). After a turbulent steady state develops, three regimes are observed: (i) a weakly stratified, overturning regime, (ii) a strongly stratified, scouring regime and (iii) an intermediately stratified, intermittent regime. The overturning regime exhibits partially formed overturning billows that break down into turbulence and broaden the velocity and buoyancy interfaces. Conversely, the scouring regime exhibits internal gravity waves propagating along the strongly stratified buoyancy interface, while turbulence on either side of the buoyancy interface reinforces the stratification. The intermediate regime quasi-periodically alternates between behaviours associated with the overturning and scouring regimes. For each case, we quantify an appropriate measure of the efficiency of mixing and examine its dependence on relevant parameters including appropriate definitions of the buoyancy Reynolds number, gradient Richardson number and horizontal Froude numbers. Using a framework involving sorted buoyancy coordinates as introduced by Nakamura (J. Atmos. Sci., vol. 53, 1996, pp. 1524-1537) and Winters \& D'Asaro (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 317, 1996, pp. 179-193), we examine the underlying physical mechanisms leading to broadening and thinning of the buoyancy interface.},

  abstract = {Critical balance, a statement of the approximate equality of a timescale of motion parallel to the magnetic field with a timescale of turbulent motion perpendicular to the field, is analyzed from a statistical description of the relative motion of two particles consistent with two-point correlation in a nonlinear gyrokinetic system with collisions. Critical balance is understood from a premise that the fastest time to any spatial scale that encounters decorrelated motions sets an overall correlation time for both perpendicular and parallel scales. For a regime of weak collisionality, this leads to the approximate equality of the parallel streaming time and the perpendicular turbulent correlation time, which is a standard statement of critical balance. These two timescales are only approximately equal because of effects in parallel streaming dynamics and collisions, the former producing deviations tied to variations of perpendicular and parallel wavenumbers. Analysis of a collisional regime shows that critical balance also applies in that limit with a modified relation between parallel and perpendicular spatial scales.},
