        - Sketch graphs of magnetic field growth
        - Motivation for my study
            - We need hi-res simulations (past simulations had bad resolution or sketchy methods)
- Second half: quantitative details
    - Linear analysis (kh growth rate)
    - Turbulence cascade
        - Kolmogorov theory
        - Zeroth law of turbulence?
    - Spectral methods for simulation


# Revised:

- Neutron star mergers
    - Gravitational wave emission causes collision
    - GRB's observed, we want a good quantitative explanation
    - GRB's need very strong magnetic fields, so how are these generated?
    - Zoom into KH instability in contact region
- Kelvin-Helmholtz instability
    - Navier-Stokes equation
        - Motivate by F=MA for fluids
        - Viscosity: fluid drags on itself
        - Write the continuity equation?
        - Just write it down and say what each term means
        - Important result: Bernoulli's principle
    - Apply Bernoulli principle to shear flow
    - Instability: disturbances grow uncontrollably
- Magnetohydrodynamics:
    - Substituting u for J in Maxwell's equation
    - 3 biggest results: say and then draw
        - Field lines get dragged with the flow
        - Stretching a field line amplifies it
        - Putting opposing field lines close together causes reconnection
        - Draw it for KH instability
    - Use these to make a dynamo
- Can KH produce a dynamo?
    - Yes
    - My research: how much and how quickly?
