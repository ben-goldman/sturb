** Critical balance and scaling of strongly stratified turbulence at low Prandtl number

def: $Pr = \nu/\kappa$
- Usually $Pr ~ O(1)$
- But in stars, we have $Pr \ll 1$ because photons go very far compared to how quickly fluid moves.
- Are we including MHD in simulations?
- When $Pr ~ 1$ we have vertical length scales of $I_z ~ FrL$ where
  - $I_z$ is vertical length scale
  - $Fr = u/\sqrt{gL}$ is the ratio of speed to speed of gravity waves, dimensionless speed
